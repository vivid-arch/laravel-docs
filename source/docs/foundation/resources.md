# Resources

Vivid will also group the resources in to their respective devices. If your application uses Blade you can use the resources directory
in order to place the assets inside.

**Directory structure**
```
/resources
    /<device name>
        /js
        /lang
        /sass
        /views
```

If you are taking an API-only approach, you can delete this directory.
