# Roadmap

The plan for the `vivid-foundation` package is to be extremely stable and compatible with all future releases. With a clean and pre-defined philosophy, we want to avoid
adding new concepts to the core architecture of Vivid unless it's something extremely important.

Having said that, there are some very ambitious things that will be added to the complementary packages of Vivid.
